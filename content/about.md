My name is Daniel Braby and I am a Higher Statistical Officer and Statistician with [Forest Research](https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/).


Previously I was pursuing a PhD in Political Science at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, where I specialised in ideal-point estimation models for political text.


I have a book chapter, Scaling Models in Political Science, in the [The Encyclopedia of Technology and Politics](https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/gbp/elgar-encyclopedia-of-technology-and-politics-9781800374256.html) due out in October of this year through Edward Elgar Publishing.

With my friend and colleague Fraser Stewart I created and maintained [parlScot: a dataset of 1.8 million speeches in the Scottish Parliament](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/EQ9WBE).
